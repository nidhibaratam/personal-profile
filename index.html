          Hello! Welcome to my website. I am a student at LNMIIT, 
          studying Electronics and Communication engineering.
           I am a highly motivated, disciplined student and a person of integrity. 
           Engineering has always been an integral part of my life, and it is
            important to me that I continue to hone my skills by challenging
             myself both within and beyond the classroom. 
             I hope to share my efforts with you here.
        </p>
        <p class="ending-paragraph">
          In addition to providing general information about me,
          this website serves as a repository of my personal accomplishments
          and endeavors. Feel free to explore my pages using the navigation
          bar above. My goal is for you to have a good idea of what I
          am capable of by the end of your visit.

          <h3 class="about-me-subheading">Background</h3>
          <p>
            I was born and brought up in Andhra Pradesh,India. 
            I attended Timpany school.  I have always been intrigued
             by engineering from my childhood.  
             Thus that was the reason I always wished to become a good engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
             I was also a school topper.
             I have toiled to achieve 96.6 percent in my tenth grade(ICSE) and
              90.25 percent in my twelfth grade(ISC). With great determination, 
              I worked hard to crack the JEE mains and passed with flying colors 
              at 95.5 percentile on schooling.
          <p>
            I was always intrigued by technology, which made me take up programming
             as one of my electives in high school and college.
             At the university level, I also learned many new subjects 
             based on electronics. Now I am a student who is excited to build 
             a career in computers and electronics.
          </p>
          <h3 class="about-me-subheading">Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            I am also a sportsperson. 
            I have won a medal in state level skating competition. 
            I also like to paint in the oil medium, I had this hobby for 6 years.
